Description: The strength of evidence provided by epidemiological and observational 
            studies is inherently limited by the potential for unmeasured confounding. 
            We focus on three key quantities: the observed bound of the confidence interval
            closest to the null, a plausible residual effect size for an unmeasured continuous 
            or binary confounder, and a realistic mean difference or prevalence difference for 
            this hypothetical confounder. Building on the methods put forth by 
            Lin, Psaty, & Kronmal (1998) <doi:10.2307/2533848>, we can use these quantities to 
            assess how an unmeasured confounder may tip our result to insignificance, rendering the
            study inconclusive.
